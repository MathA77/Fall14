You can add files and directories using the '+' symbol.  You can see this symbol above where it reads 'Fall14/+'.  To add a file, press '+', enter the file name, and enter the content of the file.  To add a new file in a new folder, use the same process except write the name of the new folder before the file, i.e new\_folder/new\_file.  Do not forget to distinguish the type of file you create, e.g. new\_file.py for a python script, or new\_file.mat for a matlab script, etc.
